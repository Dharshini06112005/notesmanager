Student Notes Manager

A very simple project to keep short study notes.

- Put subject notes inside the `notes` folder (one file per subject).
- Use `todo.txt` to list topics you still need to study.
- Use `progress.txt` to jot down daily progress.

This is for beginners who want an easy place to track study notes.
